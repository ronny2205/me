			<h1>Ronny Almog</h1>
			<p><i>Web developer</i></p>

			<p>
				Creative thinker with a strong logical bent 
				<br /><br />
				 I have a wide range of experience, from coding for an elite unit in the Israeli defense force to screening my films in international film festivals around the world.
				 <br /><br />
				 Over the last several months, I've been immersed full time in the Firehose project, where I have learned languages like Ruby on Rails
				 and JavaScript, built web apps from scratch, picked up the latest tool of the trade for web developers
				 (from Heroku to Slack to GitHub), engaged with an exciting team of developers-in-progress,
				 helped lead portions of the project development, and assisted team members in finding solutions to sticky challenges,
				 all while being mentored by leaders in the industry, from Jeremy Friesen to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenmazaika/en"> Ken Mazaika </a> to Travis Johnson.
